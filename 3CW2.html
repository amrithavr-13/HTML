    <h1>IMPORTANT NOTICE</h1>
    <div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">A-Block under construction <span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="position: absolute;">construction</span></h2>
        <img src="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/construction-new-school-building-progress-260nw-1907901997.jpg" alt="A-block unded4r construction" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin: 15px">
        <p>This is to inform all students, staff, and parents that the school’s A Block is currently under construction as part of ongoing development and improvement work. In the interest of safety, no student is permitted to enter, loiter, or play in or around the A Block area until the construction work is fully completed and officially declared safe. The area may contain construction materials, machinery, and other potential hazards that could lead to serious injury.
            As a result of this construction, all classes previously conducted in A Block have been temporarily shifted to other designated classrooms within the school campus. Students are requested to carefully check the school notice board for the updated list of class locations, room numbers, and any further instructions. Everyone is expected to strictly follow these guidelines and cooperate with school authorities to ensure a safe and smooth academic environment during this period.
