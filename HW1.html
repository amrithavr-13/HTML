        <dt>Watching Movies/Series</dt>
        <dd>I love watching movies/series beacuse it gives me joy.It transcends me into another realm of experience.It makes me think.It makes me want to change myself in a good way.And moreover it allows you too see world thorugh another person's POV. </dd>
        <dt>Reading Books</dt>
        <dd>It is a hobby that i would like to expand.Currently I am reading an autobiography and I love it.Like movies/series transcends you to another world books take you elsewhere as well maybe even in more exciting ways.Books grand us a special kind of freedom for our creative visualisation which is an amazing way to build up your coagnitive skills.</dd>
        <dt>Cooking</dt>
        <dd>Cooking interested me since long back.I love trying new recipes alone.It gives much good mental space and peace.</dd>
